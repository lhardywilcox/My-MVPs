## Description

This application takes user input to prompts in the CLI, and allows the user to keep track of their business' employees, their departments and roles.  It provides an easier way to interact with the mysql database, and makes the information easier to access.

I encountered a lot of challenges with this project.  It is difficult for me to lay out exactly how I want the application to work, and then translate that into code in such a short length of time.  I have made progress, and am pleased that what I have so far works.  I look forward to returning to this assignment, to make some additions to the code, especially as I continue to learn more and have more practice.

## Installation

In the CLI, run npm i to install the required dependencies for the application.  To start the application, type node server.js.

## Usage

The application starts by asking the user to choose what they would like to do from a menu.  The application then makes the appropriate calls on the database, to meet their needs, and returns them to the menu for another choice.
 
## Credits

I referred to the class exercises to assist with my development of this application.
